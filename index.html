<h2 class="mid">MULTI EFFECT EVAPORATOR (MEE) – PROCESS SYSTEM APPLICATIONS</h2>
<p>
<h4><b>Functioning/Operation of Technology:</b></h5>
<ul>
<li>A multi effect evaporator consists of a set of interconnected evaporators where the first effect is the first evaporator, and so on.</li>
<li>Using a multi effect evaporator, the operation is based on the steam produced in one effect being used as the heat source for the following effect.</li>
<li>When extra heat (in the form of Thermic fluid) is available, the multi effect evaporators can take advantage of it and are highly competitive.</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Salient features of our MEE system:</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>Our system is a 7 effect MEE with a pre-heater and storage tank for the condensate. The number of effects could be reduced depending on the heat input and effluent to be treated.</li>
<li>Quantity of effluent recycled is around 1 lakh liters/day.</li>
<li>Amount of heat input required in the form of Thermic Fluid is around 6.5 lakh kcal/hr.</li>
<li>Required temperature of Thermic fluid is around 210 degree celsius.</li>	
<li>Time taken by the system to reach steady state is around 3 hours after which it operates smoothly for given constant heat input and effluent flowrate.</li>
<li>There will be two outputs. One will be low pressure steam which can be reused in the process house and high temperature condensate with TDS around 20 ppm which can be used either in boiler feed water or in bleaching, dyeing, etc</li>
<li>There will be two pumps in the system. One high pressure pump for feed input and other to transport high temperature condensate to the pre-heater.</li>
<li>Maintenance will be based on the type of usage:</li>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Dyeing:</b> Tubes should be cleaned with jet pump through hand hole of the evaporator once in a week & tubes should be taken out to clean once in a month.</li>
		<li><b>Bleaching:</b> Tubes should be cleaned with jet pump through hand hole of the evaporator once in 2 weeks and tubes should be removed once in a month.</li>
	</ol>
</ul>
<h4><b>Textile Industries waste water recycle (90%):</b></h4>
<ul><li>Textile industries are generating colored waste water having high COD can be recycled and reused, using multi effect evaporation system to get distilled cold/hot water for captive consumption – making zero discharge.
</li></ul>
